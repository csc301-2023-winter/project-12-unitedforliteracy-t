# **Iteration 2 Review**

## **Discuss your team’s performance and process changes**

**What Worked Well**
Our team did well to merge our parts from the previous assignment together in order to create this deliverable as an improved continuation of assignment 2. We also did a good job to split up the work and ensure that everyone was working on something that they were familiar with or were interested in from the previous assignment. We allowed everyone to try new things if they wanted to which worked well since everyone was doing something they wanted to work on. We also had regular and constant communication within the group and with the partners as well which helped manage expectations and ensure our progress was headed in a positive direction. 

**What Didn’t Work Well**

## **How will you plan to continue working together**
We will continue to plan our tasks early so that we know what we are working on and we are able to split up the work so that everyone can contribute in some way. We will also make sure to keep a steady stream of communication between us and the partners so we can make sure that their needs are being met and the project is continuing in a direction that they want.
