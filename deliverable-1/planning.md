> _Note:_ This document will evolve throughout your project. You commit regularly to this file while working on the project (especially edits/additions/deletions to the _Highlights_ section). 
 > **This document will serve as a master plan between your team, your partner and your TA.**

## Product Details
 
#### Q1: What is the product?

 > Short (1 - 2 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Specify if you have a partner and who they are.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app, browser extension, command-line app, etc.?      
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
    * Assume your the reader knows nothing about the partner or the problem domain and provide the necessary context. 
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.      
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * **Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams, mock-ups and/or links**.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

  > Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * Be specific (e.g. a 'a third-year university student studying Computer Science' and not 'a student')
 * **Feel free to use personas. You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).**

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

> Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how and how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)
    * Does this application exist in another form? If so, how does your differ and provide value to the users?
    * How does this align with your partner's organization's values/mission/mandate?

#### Q4: What are the user stories that make up the Minumum Viable Product (MVP)?

 * At least 5 user stories concerning the main features of the application - note that this can broken down further
 * You must follow proper user story format (as taught in lecture) ```As a <user of the app>, I want to <do something in the app> in order to <accomplish some goal>```
 * User stories must contain acceptance criteria. Examples of user stories with different formats can be found here: https://www.justinmind.com/blog/user-story-examples/. **It is important that you provide a link to an artifact containing your user stories**.
 * If you have a partner, these must be reviewed and accepted by them. You need to include the evidence of partner approval (e.g., screenshot from email) or at least communication to the partner (e.g., email you sent)

#### Q5: Have you decided on how you will build it? Share what you know now or tell us the options you are considering.

> Short (1-2 min' read max)
 * What is the technology stack? Specify languages, frameworks, libraries, PaaS products or tools to be used or being considered. 
 * How will you deploy the application?
 * Describe the architecture - what are the high level components or patterns you will use? Diagrams are useful here. 
 * Will you be using third party applications or APIs? If so, what are they?

## Teamwork Details

#### Q6: Have you met with your team?

During the group meeting on Zoom, we introduced ourselves and did a few ice-breakers to get to know each other better. We talked about where everyone is from, our interests, our course load for the semester, and learned some fun facts about each other. We were unable to meet in person since we are not all in the same area, but we still got to know each other online. Other than our Zoom meeting, we also have a Discord server for communication.

Fun Facts:
We have a member in the group who is double the age of everyone else.
There’s a member in the group named Mcgill but he goes to U of T. 
We all come from different cultures and backgrounds but agree that soccer should be called football!


#### Q7: What are the roles & responsibilities on the team?

Roles & Brief Descriptions:
Front-end: UI/UX design, prototyping, focus on what the users see and interact with.
Back-end: Server-side software, implementing features, APIs, site architecture.
Databases: On the back-end side of things, focused on the databases aspect.
Product Manager: Organizes the team, meetings, and communicates with the client.
Partner Liaison: Will attend meetings with partners, keep a line of communication open with them.

Team Members & Roles:

Syeda Fatimeh Hassan:
Front-End/Back-End Developer

I’m interested in full-stack development so I chose to work on both front-end and back-end depending on the needs of my team. I have experience with both but I am interested in learning more and growing my skillset in these areas which is why I decided to contribute in this way and take on those roles. As for non-software related work, I’m a very organized person and I have been trying my best to help facilitate group meetings, create and write in shared documents, and thoroughly read through handouts to make sure we complete everything correctly.

Ibrahim Bess:
DataBases/Backend/Product Manager

I like working with databases, it feels natural to me. Also very interested in Backend programming because I enjoy setting up the core and basis of any job. I want to play the product Manager role because I want to make sure everything is going as plan (I hope I will not be too annoying :) ) 

Corinne Lee Slew: 
Front-end: 
I have experience with UX and Web design so I would be more interested in working on the front-end and see how this integrates when doing front-end development. I can also work on doing the prototype. But I will be able to help my team members in the backend as well as I am currently taking related courses.

Heng-Kuan Chen:
Front-end/Back-end/Product Manager/Partner Liaison

I’m interested in doing front-end because it’s more interactive. I am also taking courses relevant to the front-end so this would be a good experience implementing the skills that I just learned. I also have experiences in the back-end from relevant courses, so I am open to the role as well. I am one of the Partner Liaison because I have decent communication skills and I’m reachable most of the time. I’m also willing to be the product manager because I am currently taking only 3 courses, so my schedules are more flexible in comparison to my team members. 

Xing Ling:
Front-end/Back-end/Databases
I’m interested in full-stack and databases because I took relevant courses and want to put my knowledge into practice. I’ve only used Django as backend, React frontend, and Postgresql - I hope to learn other tech stacks in this project and expand my skill sets. Non-software related: I will do my best to help other members with their difficulties and do relevant research/googling.

Meet Patel:
Front-end/Partner Liaison
I am interested in front-end development and I have had previous experience in relevant courses. I chose this role as I would like to apply my learning to a more practical, large-scale software implementation. Furthermore, as the dedicated partner liaison, I am responsible for maintaining consistent communication with the partner and relaying important information to either the team or partner. I have a flexible schedule that allows me to attend all the partner meetings.

Sari Hammad:
Front-end/Back-end

I have decent experience with both, and generally don’t have a preference. Seeing as more people on the team prefer front-end and I have slightly less experience with backend, I would like to use this project as an opportunity to improve my back-end development skills - in particular, I would like to learn new technologies that are currently used that I haven’t applied before; for instance, Node/Express, Spring, etc. 


#### Q8: How will you work as a team?

Team meetings will be held online on Zoom due to the differing schedules and locations of the group members. They will be recurring 2 times a week. The purpose of each meeting is to discuss the progress each member has made throughout the week and what they have worked on. Additionally, the group will talk about any future goals or tasks that need to be accomplished. We may also complete code reviews if needed. Furthermore, the dedicated partner liaisons will bring up any information or requests provided by the partner. They will ask the team if they have any questions for the partner as well so that the liaison can relay it forward. Any quick communication between group members will be facilitated through Discord or email. Our meeting schedule will be 8:30 pm on Wednesdays for a check-in meeting during the week, and we will have longer meetings on Saturdays/Sundays starting at 1 pm to discuss our tasks for the week and complete anything else we need to.

Meeting 1:
[Describe partner meeting]
  
#### Q9: How will you organize your team?

We will be using Discord to organize our team. We have created to-do lists and meeting schedules on Discord to keep track of what we need to do as well as our meeting times to make sure everyone is able to attend. We have also created sub-channels on our discord to further divide our team into specific task groups and keep our communication organized. We have a Google Drive for shared documents that everyone has access to, and we will use this to keep track of important documents, including ones we use for planning, minutes, and assignment-related work. We will prioritize tasks according to the needs of the partner as well as the capabilities of the team. Tasks will get assigned to team members based on their strengths, interests, and contributions to the team so far. The status of work will be determined through the success of different features, modules, prototypes, code that will go through several stages of review. We will ensure everyone will contribute as much as they can by discussing the work they have completed and having regular check-ins.

#### Q10: What are the rules regarding how your team works?

Communication will be facilitated through Zoom for team meetings, Microsoft Teams for partner meetings, and Discord/email for any quick communication or questions between team members. We will have weekly check-ins as well as keep each other updated on important tasks or things we are working on. We will expect everyone to be responsive when it comes to discussing meetings or important questions. We hold ourselves to strong expectations and require that team members attend meetings and respond to any communication in a timely manner. Although, we do understand if someone has a schedule conflict or is running late, we will try our best to make accommodations. If it is a recurring issue, we will discuss it and ensure that everyone attends meetings on time and actively participates. We have discussed our expectations for each other and we know how to reach each other if any of us are unresponsive. We also expect everyone to contribute equally and if we feel that someone is lacking, we will make sure to let them know. Other than that, we have discussed our answers for Q8 and Q9 from A1 and have written them down below so everyone in the group is aware of how to reach each other if someone is being particularly unresponsive or is not contributing enough to the team.

Fatimeh: I will be as responsive as possible, and will reply to communication and messages as soon as I can. If I am not responsive when needed, a private message on Discord or an @ping will most likely catch my attention since I have push notifications enabled. If that does not work, my email is also an option as I regularly check that as well. 

Heng-Kuan: I will try to be responsive at any time. I check messages regularly throughout the day. In cases that I am not responsive my team members could @myname on discord to make sure the push notifications can be seen on my phone. At the last resort or in emergencies, my teammates can call me through my personal number(416-475-8492) or email me at “hengkuan.chen@mail.utoronto.ca”. 

Sari: I would personally try my best to be responsive at all times and make this project my biggest priority. In the case that I am not responsive when needed, I urge anyone from my team to reach out and contact me on Discord. I regularly check my Discord and should hopefully always be responsive when needed. As a last resort, my teammates have my phone number and can call or WhatsApp me if necessary.

Corinne: I usually check messages throughout the day but if I’m slow to respond in most cases it means that I’m in class so I’m not checking my phone. If anything urgent, send me a message on discord or email me.

Xing: I have Discord push message on my phone so if anyone @me I’ll respond. If any work is assigned to me or I choose to take any task, I’ll do it. If I didn’t respond on Discord, send me an email because I might have missed the message (worst case).

Meet: I try to be responsive at all times and I make sure that I am frequently reading emails or Discord messages so that I can respond in a timely manner. If I do not respond, anyone from the team can ping me on Discord or send me an email.

Ibrahim: I will check daily and be responsive as much as possible. I want to attend all meetings and do all tasks I have as soon as possible. Will put more effort when needed.
